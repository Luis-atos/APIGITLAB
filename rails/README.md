# Gitlab Rails Console

While some of the usecases are similar. These examples use the `gitlab-rails console` instead of the API. Accessing the console gives you a lot of access (database, repositories, etc), but its also raw access which means it can be dangerous.

> Proceed with caution



## Usage

```
gitlab-rails console
```
